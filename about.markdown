Hi! <br>
My name is Donald Pfaffmann, I am 25 years old and I live in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany.
Currently I am pursuing my master's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Saarland University.
<br><br>
If I had to condense my motivation in life into one word, it would be __learning__.<br>
Learning new things is the driving force of my life. In a more general sense it is learning and improving.
And improving happens via applying learned knowledge. To my mind, the famous quote *knowledge is power* is incomplete. It should rather read: *applied knowledge is power!* Because if you know, but do not apply, you might as well have not known at all...<br>
Against this background, I am always looking for opportunities to learn and apply - not only my knowledge, but also myself!<br>
Therefore, I am really happy that I seized the opportunity to travel to India for a 6-month internship at Springer Nature Technology and Publishing Solutions. Looking back at this experience, I can say that it aligned perfectly with what I wanted: __to learn__ - not only in regards to Artificial Intelligence, but also about Indian culture, work ethic and people.<br>
Now that I know whats out there, I have to go: I have to learn what the world offers!
<br><br>
Furthermore, I firmly believe that access to free education should be considered a fundamental human right.
In this sense I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to participate in the <a href="https://www.doorstepschool.org/pune/">__Door Step School__</a>, which gives underprivileged children in India exactly that.<br>
Although I am aware that this is only a small contribution, it is a step in the right direction and I plan to continue to commit to this vision!
<br><br>
I will meet you out there~<br>
Regards, Donald.
