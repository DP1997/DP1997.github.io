Hi! <br>
My name is Donald Pfaffmann, I am 22 years old and I live in Offenbach a.d.Q. in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.<br>
Currently I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in applied computer science at the University of Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern.<br>
If I had to condense my motivation in life in one word, it would be __learning__.<br>
Learning new things is the driving force of my life. In a more general sense it is learning and improving.
And imporving happens via applying learned knowledge. To my mind, the famous quote *knowledge is power* is lacking. It should rather read: *applied knowledge is power!* Because if you know, but do not apply, you might as well have not known at all...<br>
Against this background, I am always looking for opportunities to learn and apply - not only my knowledge, but also myself!<br>
Therefore, I am really happy that I seized the opportunity to travel to India for 6 months for an internship at Springer Nature Technology and Publishing Solutions. Looking back at this experience, I can say that it alligned perfectly with what I wanted: __to learn__. This is not only in regards to Computer Science, but stretches much further than that. Learning about Indian culture, work ethic and people!<br>
Now that I know whats out there, I have to go: I have to learn what the world offers!
<br>
I will meet you out there~<br>
Regards, Donald.
