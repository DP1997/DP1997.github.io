As the work I completed during my internship at SN TPS is __confidential__, I can't tell you much about it.
I think it is best to stick to my [internship certificate]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/SNTPS_internship_certificate.pdf) in this regard. It will give you a basic overview. Furthermore, my [resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/resume_Donald_Pfaffmann.pdf) also elaborates to some extend about my work there.

For my stay in India, I received a schoolarship from <a href="https://www.daad.de/en/">__DAAD__</a> (German Academic Exchange Service).<br>
You can find the certificate [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/Stipendienurkunde_DAAD_19.jpg).
