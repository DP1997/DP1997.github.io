In this project I build and programmed a 4x4x4 LED-Cube in a team of two people.
It is based on an Arduino Uno R3, which is the *brains* of the cube.
It not only connects all parts of the cube physically, but also runs the code that executes different light patterns.<br>
The cube is equipped with an infrared sensor which enables the user to set different, predefined light patterns via a remote control. Furthermore, the cube features a soundsensor. Set to the respective mode, the cube can respond to soundwaves, playing light patterns in accordance to the strength of the wave.<br>
I think the strengths of the cube are best conveyed via a video:<br>
