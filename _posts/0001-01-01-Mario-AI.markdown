In this project I implemented an autonomous agent operating Mario through randomly generated levels by utilizing the A*-search in a team of two. The major challenge was coming up with a proper heuristic that maximizes the score of Mario. We placed third in an oï¬ƒcial competition held among all course members.<br>
I think a video will paint a clearer picture of what the agent does:

Notice the *lag*-spikes in the video - these are the times that the processor has to boulder a heavy computanial load. This happens when the agent has to consider a lot of different paths (a lot of enemies can trigger this), in order to calculate the best one (highest score).<br>
Keep in mind that the agent can see further than the actual screen width, spotting enemies before they appear on screen.<br>
The red line represents the most recent calculation of the optimal path calculated by the agent.<br>
__You will need this [jar]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/marioAI-1.6.jar) in combination with the code to run the agent!__
