In this project I developed a *Run & Gun* game for Android smartphones in a team of two.
The app is written in Java and without the aid of any frameworks.
That means everything is *handmade*: from the bitmap transformations to the physics of the ball (bounce effect).
We were quite proud of this one!<br><br>

Explanation when first starting the actual game:

I think it is best to let the game speak for itself :).<br>
Please have a look at the video below for an impression of the actual gameplay.<br><br>
