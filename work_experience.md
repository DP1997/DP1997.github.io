For information about my work in the EXPECT project as a research assistant at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (Cognitive Assistants department), please refer to the <a href="https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/de/forschung/projekte/expect/">__official website__</a>.

As the work I completed during my internships at __SN TPS__ and __Daimler Truck AG__ is __confidential__, I can't tell you much about it.
I think it is best to stick to my internship certificates in this regard. They will provide you with a basic overview. You can find them in the following:
<br>

[Bachelor Thesis Internship Certificate at Daimler Truck AG]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/Daimler_Truck_AG_Arbeitszeugnis_Pfaffmann.pdf)<br>
Please take note of the fact that certificate is written in German. [Here]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/Daimler_Truck_AG_internship_certificate_Pfaffmann.pdf) you can find an unofficial translation of the certificate to English.

For my stay in India, I received a schoolarship from <a href="https://www.daad.de/en/">__DAAD__</a> (German Academic Exchange Service).
You can find the certificate [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/Stipendienurkunde_DAAD_19_Pfaffmann.jpg).

Furthermore, my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/curriculum_vitae_Pfaffmann.pdf) also elaborates to some extend about my work there.
